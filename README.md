# Task with Flask
TaskManager-Flask is a simple web-based task management application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy. The app uses SQLite as the database to store tasks, and each task has an associated creation date and completion status. The user interface is built with HTML and Jinja templates to dynamically display the tasks in a user-friendly way.
